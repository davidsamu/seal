# Naming convention for recorded files

Recordings and generated data files should follow the following naming template:

*SSS_MMDDYYee_EE.EXT*

where

- *SSS* is the subject name (monkey ID, three digits), e.g. *201*
- *MMDDYY* is the date of the recording (in month, day, year order, two digits each), e.g. *062416*
- *ee* is the electrode type (one lowercase letter) and number (one digit), e.g. *v1*
- *EE* is the experiment (letters of varying length and case), e.g. *remDD*
- *EXT* is the extension of the file, *plx*, *mat* or *data*

Example:

*202_060316v1_ddX2.plx*
