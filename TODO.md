TODO list of Seal project
-------------------------


preprocessing pipeline
----------------------
  - try automatic sorting: http://simonster.github.io/SpikeSortingSoftware/
  - improve waveform duration estimation (e.g. by smoothing spline fit?)
  - latency calculation: timing and direction (by method of Zaksas 2006), per direction/location and to all combined


analyses to add from DD scripts
-------------------------------
  - decoding
    - preprocessing
    - run
    - analysis
  - comparison effect


unitarray / unit
----------------
  - add test and register whether units are matched across tasks


permutation tests
-----------------
  - identify p-value based on false positive rate during fixation


unit
----
  - add RF coverage information
  - add type information: suppressive?, broad spiking? motor? etc


decoding
--------
  - extend with error trial analysis
  - choice probability
